According to a Google research most popular IDEs are:
1)	Visual Studio – When you start programming in Visual Studios you will notice a suggestion box will appear when you start typing anything within the IDE, this is to notify the user what methods and functions are available. It Is one of the most powerful feature. Also it is famous with the automatic code formatting, for example - When you start coding a method and go to enter the “{“ brackets, the code inside those brackets will actually indent to the right;
2)	Eclipse - The interface is a lot cleaner and concise than Visual Studio. The languages mentioned above are not limited by Microsoft and anyone is free to develop plug-ins for different languages and to make the development environment easier to use. Also, you can use it on Linux. Besides being fully customizable and extensible, the next best thing about eclipse is it’s free;
3)	netbeans – This is also a free and extensible program. Instead of having multiple programs for multiple different languages, Netbeans combine them into one program;
4)	Kate – Uses Linux. One of the advantages is the “Code Folding” - There is a small column to the left of the code. Any line that is an opening bracket that column will have an arrow next to it. If you click the arrow it will fold all of the code between the opening and closing brackets. Very useful for large source packages. It doesn’t compile the code;
5)	Gedit – Also it is under Linux OS. Gedit offers the ability to highlight your code and figure out where the bugs are by giving you a fresh perspective. It doesn’t compile the code.
